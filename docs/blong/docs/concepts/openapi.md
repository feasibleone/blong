# Open API

The official OpenAPI standard is a central part of the framework. Implementing
or calling APIs is very easy when an API definition is available. Third-party
definition files can be left in original format, while extra information is
merged to them to enable easier usage or implementation.

To learn how to expose or consume OpenAPI, read the [rest pattern](../patterns/rest.md).
