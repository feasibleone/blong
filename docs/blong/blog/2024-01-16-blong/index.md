I am happy to announce the release of Blong 2024, codename Ambrym.

This framework is the result of many years of efforts around producing
reusable software. Its is descendant of the UnderTree framework, whose roots
started as a Delphi application. It aims to follow the RAD spirit of
Delphi while using TypeScript, which both have
[Anders Hejlsberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Hejlsberg) as
a lead architect.

Many of the ideas of the UnderTree framework were pioneered during my numerous
trips to the amazing country [Vanuatu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanuatu).

The name of the framework ["blong"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bislama#%22Blong%22)
is a word in Bislama, the official language of Vanuatu. It is one of the most
widely used and versatile words in the language, depicting the versatility
and the usage of the framework in various scenarios.
